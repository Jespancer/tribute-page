        <h1>Alan Watts</h1>
        <p>Alan Wilson Watts (6 January 1915 – 16 November 1973) was a British philosopher who interpreted and popularised Eastern philosophy for a Western audience.
            Born in Chislehurst, England, he moved to the United States in 1938 and began Zen training in New York.
            Pursuing a career, he attended Seabury-Western Theological Seminary, where he received a master's degree in theology.
            Watts became an Episcopal priest in 1945, then left the ministry in 1950 and moved to California, where he joined the faculty of the American Academy of Asian Studies. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts" target="_blank" class="link">Continue reading...</a>

            “If you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you'll spend your life completely wasting your time.
            You'll be doing things you don't like doing in order to go on living, that is to go on doing things you don't like doing, which is stupid.”
